Please note that this timeline is subject to change as we continue to work through any unforeseen challenges.\\n\\nRegarding the final delivery date, we anticipate a slight delay due to the extended database implementation phase. Our current estimate for final delivery is 2024-04-10T10:00:00Z. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary.\\n\\nThank you for your understanding and patience.
